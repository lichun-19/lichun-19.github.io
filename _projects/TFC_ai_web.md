###### **01 Empathize — Understanding the Literacy Gap**
<div style="border-left: 3px solid #d9d9d9; padding-left: 1rem; margin-bottom: 2rem;">
Through interviews and early testing with young users (ages 15–25), we observed several recurring attitudes toward misinformation and fact-checking:
<ul>
    <li>Users often rely on intuition or simply ignore suspicious content instead of verifying it.</li>
    <li>Fact-checking is perceived as time-consuming, difficult, or overly professional.</li>
    <li>Many users are unsure which platforms or organizations can be trusted.</li>
    <li>The consequences of misinformation are poorly understood and feel abstract.</li>
</ul>
These insights revealed that the core challenge was not a lack of concern, but a high perceived barrier to action.

###### **02 Define — Problem Statement**
<div style="border-left: 3px solid #d9d9d9; padding-left: 1rem; margin-bottom: 2rem;">
Based on our research, we defined the central problem as follows:<br><br>

<strong>Audiences who primarily consume information through digital and social media NEED a low-friction way to learn and practice fact-checking, BECAUSE existing tools feel inaccessible, untrustworthy, or too demanding for everyday use.</strong><br><br>

Our design goal was therefore to <strong>lower the threshold of fact-checking</strong>—making it feel approachable, practical, and relevant to daily life.

###### **03 Ideate — Game-Based Literacy as a Solution**
<div style="border-left: 3px solid #d9d9d9; padding-left: 1rem; margin-bottom: 2rem;">
We explored multiple approaches to media literacy education and identified interactive gameplay as the most promising direction. Compared to traditional lectures or videos, games can:
<ul>
    <li>Encourage active participation and curiosity</li>
    <li>Provide immediate feedback and learning reinforcement</li>
    <li>Simulate real-world decision-making scenarios</li>
</ul>

This led to the concept of Fact Finder: an interactive fact-checking detective game that guides players through realistic misinformation cases using step-by-step challenges.

###### **04 Prototype — Fact Finder Interactive Game**
<div style="border-left: 3px solid #d9d9d9; padding-left: 1rem; margin-bottom: 2rem;">
The prototype consists of a mobile-first web game with the following structure:<br><br>

<strong>① Progressive Game Levels</strong>
<ul>
    <li>Scenarios range from basic to advanced difficulty</li>
    <li>Players answer questions based on images, headlines, and contextual clues</li>
</ul>

<strong>② Hands-on Fact-Checking Practice</strong>
<ul>
    <li>Guided prompts introduce techniques such as reverse image search and source comparison</li>
    <li>Players learn by applying methods, not memorizing rules</li>
</ul>

<strong>③ Immediate Feedback</strong>
<ul>
    <li>Correctness is shown instantly</li>
    <li>Explanations clarify why an answer is right or wrong</li>
</ul>

<strong>④ Motivation & Sharing</strong>
<ul>
    <li>Scores and detective levels reflect users’ fact-checking ability</li>
    <li>Results can be shared, encouraging peer discussion and awareness</li>
</ul>
</div>

###### **05 Test — Evaluation & Impact**
<div style="border-left: 3px solid #d9d9d9; padding-left: 1rem; margin-bottom: 2rem;">
We conducted multiple rounds of testing (N = 4 → 8 → 38) to evaluate effectiveness:
<ul>
    <li><strong>82%</strong> of users reported improved understanding of fact-checking concepts</li>
    <li><strong>84%</strong> felt more familiar with fact-checking methods and tools</li>
    <li><strong>87%</strong> gained better awareness of available fact-checking platforms</li>
    <li><strong>74%</strong> reported increased willingness to perform fact-checking in the future</li>
</ul>
Participants highlighted that the game made fact-checking feel “less intimidating,” “more practical,” and “surprisingly engaging.”

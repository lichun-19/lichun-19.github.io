### Design Concept
<div style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word; margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 3rem;">
NEURORLD stems from the concept of a world composed of neurons, representing my mind. In this work, I create spaces that embody different emotions and feelings; meanwhile, through interactions with these spaces, users' mental states will also change correspondingly.

    NEURORLD is composed of three main spaces: the Fantasy Center, the Calming Passway, and the Secure Shelter.
</div>


**Fantasy Center**
<div style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word; margin-top: 0rem; margin-bottom: 1rem;">
The intricate and interwoven network reflects its role as the central hub of perception, embodying the complexity and progression of thoughts while maintaining a unique, personal logic that cannot be easily traversed. The upward-aligned neural structures gradually become more orderly, guiding individuals to ascend, transforming excitement and confusion into clarity and rationality during the climb. Ultimately, they reach an open, elevated vantage point to gain a comprehensive view of the whole.
</div>

**Calming Passway**
<div style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word; margin-top: 0rem; margin-bottom: 1rem;">
A gradually widening and smoother passage connects the confined, oppressive private spaces to an open and public terrace, guiding those harboring anger or sorrow toward the expansive area to help soothe intense emotions.
</div>

**Secure Shelter**
<div style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word; margin-top: 0rem; margin-bottom: 3rem;">
A smooth and delicate material envelops the shelter with a single entrance, creating a safe and comforting space for those experiencing fear or vulnerability. The upper portion remains open and unobstructed, preventing excessive shadows that could heighten fear, allowing sunlight—symbolizing hope and warmth—to naturally light up the space.

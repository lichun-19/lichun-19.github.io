### Design Concept
<div style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word; margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 3rem;">
Architecture is not limited to solid buildings. The following three points are necessary elements that form the spirit of architecture in my mind.
</div>

**Container of Time & Space**
<div style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word; margin-top: 0rem; margin-bottom: 1rem;">
Historical architecture stands for hundreds or even thousand of years. It has participated in era changes, where cultures and generation altered. Therefore, architecture has the ability to contain space as well as time.
</div>

**Connection between Users and Environments**
<div style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word; margin-top: 0rem; margin-bottom: 1rem;">
Boundaries define spaces of different functions. Yet architecture should serve as the connection, instead of isolating users from the environments.
</div>

**Arouse Activities and Interactions**
<div style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word; margin-top: 0rem; margin-bottom: 3rem;">
Entries, exits, and even boundaries affect traffic flows. Architecture creates specific atmosphere and arouse activities happen. People interact with each other; humans interact with surroundings.

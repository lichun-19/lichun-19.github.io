### Design Concept
<div style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word; margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 3rem;">
Collaborators | Wen-Shin Lin, Huai-Yun Hung, Ya-Pin Chang, Luo Su, Min-Shin Fang, Jun-Ye Mai<br>
We designed a triangular-prism modular unit that collectively forms an organic structure enveloping the department entrance. The installation provides a softer spatial guidance that invites passersby to pause, linger, and interact, transforming the entrance from an everyday passageway into an experiential space.<br><br>

The cut angles along the edges and the openings of each unit enable a wide range of combinable and graftable configurations. This design balances modularity with continuity, allowing flexible assemblies while preserving soft, rounded spatial lines.

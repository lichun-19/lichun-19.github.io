### Introduction

<div style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-word; margin-top: 1rem; margin-bottom: 3rem;">
    Collaborators | Jing-Hsiang Hsu, Wan-Chi Wang<br>
    During our participation in the Design Thinking Workshop at NTU D-School, we applied the design thinking process to a project focused on improving the travel experience of pet owners. This led to the development of a user-centered prototype website designed to make pet-friendly travel easier and more enjoyable.<br>

    The platform is designed to reduce preparation time by up to 60% and integrates five key functions, including recommended and customizable itineraries, transportation services, equipment rental, and more.

###### **01 Empathize — Understanding Pet Owners’ Needs**
<div style="border-left: 3px solid #d9d9d9; padding-left: 1rem; margin-bottom: 2rem;">
We began by conducting semi-structured interviews (N=3) with pet owners to understand their experiences, frustrations, and unmet needs when traveling with pets. We explored:<br> 
    <ul> 
        <li>Background and routines of the owner and pet</li> 
        <li>Difficulties and emotional challenges during trips</li> 
        <li>Causes behind unmet needs and expectations for an ideal travel experience</li> 
    </ul> 
Using these insights, we created a user persona representing owners who love traveling with their pets but feel overwhelmed by the preparation workload.<br> 
</div>

###### **02 Define — Insights & Problem Statement**
<div style="border-left: 3px solid #d9d9d9; padding-left: 1rem; margin-bottom: 2rem;">
Through affinity diagramming and synthesis, we identified four key needs mentioned across interviews:<br> <ul> <li>Keeping pets safe and close during outings</li> <li>Having more pet-friendly transportation options</li> <li>Clear agreements with businesses to allow pets to stay with their owners</li> <li>A simpler way to prepare for overnight trips with pets</li> </ul> A recurring theme was the low “effort-to-happiness ratio (CP 值)”—owners felt the joy of pet travel did not justify the heavy preparation required.<br><br>

<strong>Point of View (POV)</strong>:<br>
“Pet owners who dream of taking overnight trips with their dogs need a fast and simple preparation method, because balancing effort and joy is essential to them.”<br>

</div>


###### **03 Ideate — Exploring Creative Solutions**
<div style="border-left: 3px solid #d9d9d9; padding-left: 1rem; margin-bottom: 2rem;">
We used brainstorming and role-playing to generate a diverse range of ideas. After refining and combining concepts, we identified five feasible solution directions:<br> <ul> <li>Predicting owner–pet happiness levels for different trip types</li> <li>Centralizing pet-friendly travel information into one platform</li> <li>Offering flexible packaged and customized itineraries</li> <li>Establishing institutions to support pet-owner travel needs</li> <li>Building pet clubs or resorts for dedicated travel experiences</li> </ul> After evaluating feasibility and alignment with our POV, we selected the final design direction:<br><br>

<strong>→ A web platform offering pet-friendly travel recommendations, flexible trip packages, and customizable itineraries tailored to owner and pet needs.</strong><br>

###### **04 Prototype — Four-Page Web Platform**
<div style="border-left: 3px solid #d9d9d9; padding-left: 1rem; margin-bottom: 2rem;">
We created a mid-fidelity prototype consisting of four main pages:<br>

<strong>① Homepage</strong><br>

<ul> <li>Recommended pet-friendly travel packages</li> <li>Option to create customized itineraries</li> <li>A short quiz to identify suitable travel styles</li> </ul>

<strong>② Recommended Trips</strong><br>

<ul> <li>Filters for budget, stamina, pet energy level, and special needs</li> <li>Star-rated indicators for effort required, happiness, and overall suitability</li> <li>Right-panel detailed itinerary items</li> <li>Drag-and-drop actions for custom itineraries</li> </ul>

<strong>③ Custom Schedule Builder</strong><br>

<ul> <li>Visual timeline interface for arranging trip activities</li> <li>Automatic import of selected activities</li> <li>Real-time calculations for owner effort, pet energy, and total cost</li> </ul>

<strong>④ Equipment Rental & Add-On Services</strong><br>

<ul> <li>Rental of travel gear such as RVs, bowls, water bottles, and food</li> <li>Optional products like pet party outfits, swimwear, and custom birthday cakes</li> <li>Designed to reduce packing stress and preparation time</li> </ul> </div>


###### **05 Test — User Feedback & Insights**

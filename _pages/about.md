**I am interested in advancing AI's abilities in human-centered intelligence that extend beyond informative tasks (e.g., creativity, social interaction), with the vision of enhancing human life and fostering human-AI collaboration through more innovative perspectives and solutions.**

 I work at the [Robot Learning Lab](https://nturll.xyz/about), [National Taiwan University](https://www.ntu.edu.tw/english/) (NTU), advised by Professor [Shao-Hua Sun](https://shaohua0116.github.io/). I received my B.S.E. in Electrical Engineering from NTU in July 2025. During my undergraduate studies, I collaborated with Professors Shao-Hua Sun and [Hung-yi Lee](https://speech.ee.ntu.edu.tw/~hylee/index.php) on language models, where I designed a multi-agent discussion framework incorporating role-play techniques that enhances LLM's creativity. I also worked with Professor [Mike Y. Chen](https://mikechen.com/) on human-computer interaction research through virtual reality gaming.

Earilier this year, I was a visiting researcher at the [UCLA NLP Group](https://x.com/uclanlp) in Professor [Nanyun Peng](https://violetpeng.github.io/)'s [PLUS Lab](https://violetpeng.github.io/group/), where I led a project that analyzed and compared existing metrics for creativity evaluation across multiple domains, identifying key limitations and underscoring the need for more robust evaluation methods.


<!-- I am an incoming Ph.D. student at NTU [Robot Learning Lab](https://nturll.xyz/about), in collaboration with Professor [Shao-Hua Sun](https://shaohua0116.github.io/). I received my B.S.E. in Electrical Engineering from NTU in July 2025. My research interests lie in the **creativity of Large Language Models (LLMs)** and **human-AI collaboration**. I am honored to have worked with Professor Shao-Hua Sun and Professor [Hung-yi Lee](https://speech.ee.ntu.edu.tw/~hylee/index.php), where I designed a multi-agent discussion framework incorporating role-play techniques to enhance LLM creativity. 

I also conducted research as a visiting researcher at the [University of California, Los Angeles](https://www.ucla.edu/) (UCLA), in Professor [Nanyun Peng](https://violetpeng.github.io/)'s PLUS Lab (Nov 2024 – Apr 2025), where I led a project analyzing and comparing creativity metrics across domains and identifying limitations that underscore the need for improved evaluation methods.

I am an incoming Ph.D. student at NTU [Robot Learning Lab](https://nturll.xyz/about), in collaboration with Professor [Shao-Hua Sun](https://shaohua0116.github.io/). I received my B.S.E. in Electrical Engineering from NTU in July 2025. My research interests lie in the **creativity of Large Language Models (LLMs)** and **human-AI collaboration**. I am honored to have worked with Professor Shao-Hua Sun and Professor [Hung-yi Lee](https://speech.ee.ntu.edu.tw/~hylee/index.php), where I designed a multi-agent discussion framework incorporating role-play techniques to enhance LLM creativity.

I also conducted research as a visiting researcher at the [University of California, Los Angeles](https://www.ucla.edu/) (UCLA), in Professor [Nanyun Peng](https://violetpeng.github.io/)'s PLUS Lab (Nov 2024 – Apr 2025), where I led a project analyzing and comparing creativity metrics across domains and identifying limitations that underscore the need for improved evaluation methods.

<!-- Aside from this, I have experiences in human-computer interaction (HCI), where I conduct  -->

I am an incoming PhD student at National Taiwan University (NTU) [Robot Learning Lab](https://nturll.xyz/about), in collaboration with Professor [Shao-Hua Sun](https://shaohua0116.github.io/). I will receive my B.S.E. in Electrical Engineering from NTU in July 2025. My research interests lie in the **creativity of Large Language Models (LLMs)** and **human-AI collaboration**. I am honored to have worked with Professor Shao-Hua Sun and Professor Hung-yi Lee, where I designed a multi-agent discussion framework incorporating role-play techniques to enhance LLM creativity.

I also conducted research as a visiting researcher at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), in Professor [Nanyun Peng](https://violetpeng.github.io/)'s PLUS Lab (Nov 2024 – Apr 2025), where I analyzed and compared creativity metrics across domains and identified limitations that highlight the need for improved evaluation methods.

I am a senior undergraduate student at National Taiwan University (NTU) in the Department of Electrical Engineering, and a research assistant in the [NTU Robot Learning Lab](https://nturll.xyz/about), working with Professor [Shao-Hua Sun](https://shaohua0116.github.io/) and co-advised by Professor [Hung-yi Lee](https://speech.ee.ntu.edu.tw/~hylee/index.php). My research interests focus on **Large Language Models' Creativity** and **Collaboration between LLMs and Humans**. Our projects also include multi-agent systems, in-context learning, and reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). 

I am currently a visiting student researcher at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), in Professor [Nanyun Peng](https://violetpeng.github.io/)'s PLUS Lab, where I am further exploring the creativity and evaluation of LLMs. I am also seeking a PhD position starting in Fall 2025. Please feel free to contact me via [email](b08901207@g.ntu.edu.tw) for any discussion!

Other than research, I enjoy outdoor activities, traveling, watching movies, cooking, and singing in choirs. Overall, I love collecting new experiences because I am a curious person!

<!-- * I may look shy, but I actually enjoy talking to people and learning about their (your) thoughts. -->
* I recently got a short haircut, yay!
